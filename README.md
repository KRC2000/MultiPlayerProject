# MultiPlayerProject
This is my client-server base for future multiplayer projects. It builds using SFML/Network module. It's in development state.

Currently contains server and client apps. Server can handle endless client numbers(as much as memory or sockets count will allow). 
Server kepps all clients updated about all other connected clients. Error protection is preatty weak yet.
