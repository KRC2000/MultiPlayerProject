# MultiPlayerProject

 This is my client-server-client base for future multiplayer projects. It builds using SFML/Network module. It's in development state.

Currently contains server and client apps. Server can handle endless client numbers(as much as memory or sockets count will allow). 
Server keeps all clients updated about all other connected clients. Basically its a base chamber that im building my network module for further easy embedding in any sfml game
